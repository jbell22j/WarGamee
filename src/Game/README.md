# War Game

## Introduction
In this project, we were assigned the task of recreating the classic playing card game [War](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/War_(card_game)) (description of the game and how it is played) within Java. 

## Tools Used
* [Java](https://www.oracle.com/java/) is a programming language and computing platform, there are still many applications and even some websites that will not function unless you have a desktop Java installed.

## Classes
There are three classes used within our project to create our functioning war game. These classes include:
* 'Cards.java'
